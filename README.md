# BeginnerDeepLearning
A repository to contain my needs for version control as I try to learn Deep Learning, Neural Networks, NLP, LLM &amp; model building.

- **Why?** Because I want to build my own AI model.
- **Why?** Because it's fun &amp; like having my own child.

Want to follow along? I have made Jupyter notebooks to make it easier to document things and follow a step-by-step process of learning.
- Will show how to make your own model 🐣

The project assumes that you have "basics-ish" on:
```
- Git
- Algorithms
- How to program
- Python
- A lot of math
```

View the file `DigitMNST/00_getstarted.ipynb` to read about how to get started.

> - Made with Python, Jupyter, Tensorflow 🦖
> - By KB
